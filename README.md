# FMTabBarController
A lightweight TabBar ViewController which allows various customisations not possible with the default TabBar.

## Open issues

* add a demo project
* add a proper usage documentation
* add optional animations to FMTabBarButton

## Requirements

iOS 9.1 or higher

## Usage
 1. Add the project files from the 'FMTabBarController' Folder to your project.
 2. Go to the ViewController.swift file of your root ViewController and make it inherit from 'FMTabBarController'
 3. In your viewDidLoad() you can now add buttons to the tabbar and customize it further. (Have a look at the demo project to get a better understanding.)
 4. In order to make the segues work, just go to your storyboard and add segues by ctrl - dragging from your root viewController to your destination viewController. Change the type of the segue to 'FMTabBarSegue' in the attribues inspector and assign a identifier. (I recommend something like 'VC-i', where is the i-th button of the tabBar.)
 5. By overwriting the tabBarButtonPressed() method in your ViewController.swift file you can e.g. call performSegueWithIdentifier() by making use of the 'tag' property of the FMTabBarButton in order to trigger the proper segue. (or do complete different stuff ;-) )
